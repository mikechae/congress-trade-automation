# US Congress Trade Automation
## Welcome to my automation project!

### Purpose: The purpose of this project is to automate the simple pull and write processes of US Congress member aggregated trade data into a local Postgres database for further analysis.

### Logical Components: This project is separated into the following components:
#### 1. Sending request to the Senate Stock Watcher API
#### 2. Receiving API response and normalizing to load in PG DB
#### 3. Connecting and Authenticating to local PG DB
#### 4. Creating table in local DB and writing to said table
#### 5. Automating this process to run daily using Apple Automator
